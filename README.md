# Hofstedes-Cultueral-Dimensions-and-Happiness

In this project, we examine the research question: to what extent does a relationship exist between freedom as a determinant of happiness and Hofstede’s six cultural dimensions?

Hofstede’s Six Cultural Dimensions is a model of basic issues that portray how a society is organized. Each dimension is represented on an index scale (1-100).

Individualism vs Collectivism — “Individualism is the extent to which people feel independent, as opposed to being interdependent as members of larger wholes.”

Power Distance — “Power Distance is the extent to which the less powerful members of organizations and institutions (like the family) accept and expect that power is distributed unequally.”

Masculinity — “Masculinity is the extent to which the use of force in endorsed socially.”

Uncertainty Avoidance — “Uncertainty avoidance deals with a society’s tolerance for uncertainty and ambiguity.” 

Long-term Orientation — “In a long-time-oriented culture... preparing for the future is always needed.” 

Indulgence — “In an indulgent culture it is good to be free. Doing what your impulses want you to do, is good.”
